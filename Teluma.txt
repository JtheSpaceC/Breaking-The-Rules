* Mouse lock on webGL screen
* Make curious enemies stop and look for a bit, or search
* When an enemy is chasing you, make them alert nearby enemies also
* Consider doing away with pathing distance, and just alerting enemies in a room when a shot is made, and the next room if a door is open
* Some enemy shots possible going to V2.Zero

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO DO
-------
New Alert sound
Teluma room

Persistence / saving

Alert enemy triggers enemy alerts nearby

Enemies react to bodies

Set up a 2nd graphnode for sounds only? Or just be more explicit in stealth script to ray through ignorables

ROOM FILLER
-----------
Ammo boxes
Chair
Workstation


STORY

Loot boxes
More weapons / ammo / reloading
A boss that follows you slowly from the security room as you chip away at his health and hide down corridors
Level numbers on the walls
running affects accuracy badly, but increases defense
Improved left arm hologram
High Score system
Jump out and stab feature
Door for elevator
Controller support
Security cameras and global alerts
Proper system of debuffs, with a point assignable individually, instead of lumping it to one stat
Max rooms feature that increases per level

ROB
----
Add audioSource to everything that's a Cover


BUGS
-----
* If I try hit someone but I'm aiming through them and past a wall, I don't hit them
* Enemies trying to walk through furniture or each other continually
* After elevator leaves, an enemy may still try to patrol into the shaft if he was already, and gets blocked at the door.
* Pathfinding on hearing gunshots check not working properly
* Laser bends in on itself in close
* Pause doesn't pause audio
* Hacking circle sometimes didn't disappear after hacking
* In web player, pressing E can be unresponsive
* Hacking audio can continue after you're done hacking
* Sometimes get 2 or more 'map updated images'
* Laser turns off when entering elevator
* Some green outlines on the map, like on security room
* On laptops if you die, game slows dramatically
* Encountered bug on level 6 or 7 where no other rooms spawned (index out of range exception)
* Killing enemy guarding the elevator can lead him to die on the other side of the S door, or move with elevator even though he's outside it.


FEEDBACK
--------
+ Medpacks
Shoot locks/ c4 them open
Start by looking at map 
Objectives on map screen 
A* vs raycasting when close
A* to continue calcs after the frame instead of requesting a new one
A* per room, instead of over whole level
Radar sigs for doors, elevator, objectives
Elevator symbol
Highlights for cover objects on mouseover

Aesthetics

Vision cones 
Nuclear throne 


ISSUES
-----------
A* : Taking too many resources. Not working well enough.
Graphics: consistency (point vs tirlinear), animations, effects
